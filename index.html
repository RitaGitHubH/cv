        <h2>
            Medical doctor and global health consultant, shaping healthcare solutions that bridge international and digital health.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Family Medicine was my deliberate choice—a field that offers not just a wide clinical foundation, but the opportunity to truly understand and care for patients throughout every stage of their lives. In Portugal, this specialty is the cornerstone of primary care. From monitoring childhood development to guiding pregnancies, managing chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension, and conducting cancer screenings, I was trained to address the full spectrum of patient needs. It’s a field that teaches not just medicine but the art of connection, of understanding communities and individuals in equal measure.
          As I delved into this journey, I became passionate about finding ways to take this foundational approach to the next level—combining its human-centered principles with the power of technology and a global perspective.
          During my first year of training, I proposed a fresh perspective on our national electronic prescription program, which earned me an invitation from the Portuguese Ministry of Health to serve as a medical consultant. This opportunity later extended to joining the Technology Group at the Portuguese Medical Association. These experiences allowed me to witness firsthand how thoughtful, well-designed changes can create a ripple effect across the healthcare system—streamlining workflows for doctors and ultimately enhancing patient care.
          This experience ignited a deeper drive in me to innovate through technology. I began designing and coding the foundation for a European-level prescription support platform—a software solution crafted to streamline medical processes and integrate seamlessly with a medical education platform I had already developed. This combined system is more than just a tool; it represents my mission to empower the next generation of medical professionals, equipping them with both the knowledge and the practical support they need to excel in their daily practice. (Currently in the final development stages)
          To enrich this vision, I sought out learning experiences that expanded my understanding of global healthcare. I pursued a postgraduate degree in Travel and Migrant Medicine and took part in clinical internships across Europe—in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Norway, Italy, Spain, and Portugal’s Azores islands. Each experience revealed unique facets of healthcare delivery, from the intricacies of rural medicine to the challenges of urban systems. These immersive opportunities broadened my perspective and deepened my resolve to address healthcare disparities with actionable solutions.
          One of the most impactful experiences of my journey was contributing to the World Health Organization's initiatives on health and migration. Navigating the complexities of healthcare across diverse systems and settings gave me the perspective and knowledge to support meaningful global efforts. This opportunity reaffirmed the importance of uniting local primary care expertise with international collaboration.
          <strong>My career path was intentionally crafted to be unique—a deliberate blend of clinical practice, technological innovation, and global health advocacy. I sought out diverse experiences and challenges to ensure I could bring a fresh, multifaceted perspective to the table. This approach allows me to contribute innovative, forward-thinking solutions that bridge traditional healthcare with the demands of a rapidly evolving world. With this mindset and drive, I am confident in my ability to be a valuable asset to your organization, delivering meaningful impact and helping to shape the future of healthcare.</strong>
